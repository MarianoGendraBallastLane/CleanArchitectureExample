STORY DESCRIPTION:

As a user, I want to have a web application that allows me to manage my list of products. 
I want to be able to create, read, update, and delete products through API endpoints using .NET C#
Additionally, I want to be able to create a user account and securely log in to the application, 
and I want the user information to be stored in a relational database.
This will help me to keep track of my products.

ACCEPTANCE CRITERIA

The application should include a relational database with at least one table to store data for the application.
The database table should have a unique identifier (primary key) and at least two other fields.
The API should be developed using ASP.NET Web API and should have endpoints for CRUD operations.
Each API endpoint should have appropriate HTTP verbs, parameters, and return values.
The API should have endpoints for user creation, user login, and authorized and non-authorized endpoints.
The data access layer should interact with the database and provide the necessary CRUD operations for the API endpoints.
The business logic layer should include all of the business rules and validation for the application.
The business logic layer should be independent of the data layer and the API.
Unit tests should be written for all components of the application, including the data access layer, business logic layer, and API endpoints.
The unit tests should follow TDD methodologies to ensure that the code is reliable and error-free.
